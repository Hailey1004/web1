<br><p><strong>Definition of love</strong></p>
<p> I. The most spectacular, indescribable, deep euphoric feeling for someone.

Love is an incredibly powerful word. When you’re in love, you always want to be together, and when you’re not, you’re thinking about being together because you need that person and without them your life is incomplete.

This love is unconditional affection with no limits or conditions: completely loving someone. It’s when you trust the other with your life and when you would do anything for each other. When you love someone, you want nothing more than for them to be truly happy no matter what it takes, because that’s how much you care about them and because their needs come before your own. You hide nothing of yourself and can tell the other anything because you know they accept you just the way you are and vice versa.

Love can make you do anything and sacrifice for what will be better in the end. Love is intense and passionate. Everything seems brighter, happier and more wonderful when you’re in love. If you find it, don’t let it go.</p>
<p> II. An inexplainable yet incredibly strong feeling for someone.

Most people use the word “love” to get into someone else’s pants. Love is overused in today’s world; people say they love someone because of the way they look or their body. That isn’t love.

Love is when you can’t do anything without thinking about that person, and you always want to be with them. It’s not that you want to have sex with them, you just want to spend time with them and you just want to hold them and never let go.</p>
